# Deep Reasoning with Knowledge Graph for Social Relationship Understanding

This repo includes the source code of the paper: "[Deep Reasoning with Knowledge Graph for Social Relationship Understanding](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0142.pdf)" (IJCAI 2018) by Zhouxia Wang, Tianshui Chen, Jimmy Ren, Weihao Yu, Hui Cheng, Liang Lin.

## Environment

The code is implemented using the Pytorch library with Python 2.7 and has been tested on a desktop with the system of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

## Dataset
[PISC](https://zenodo.org/record/1059155#.WznPu_F97CI) was released by [[Li et al. ICCV 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00634)]. It involves a two-level relationship, i.e., coarse-level relationships with 3 categories and fine-level relationships with 6 categories.

[PIPA-relation](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/human-activity-recognition/social-relation-recognition/) was released by [[Sun et al. CVPR 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06456)]. It covers 5 social domains, which can be further divided into 16 social relationships. On this dataset, we focus on the 16 social relationships.

      --print-freq N, -p N      print frequency (default: 10)
      --weights PATH            path to weights (default: none)
      --scale-size SCALE_SIZE   input size
      --world-size WORLD_SIZE   number of distributed processes
      -n N, --num-classes N     number of classes / categories
      --write-out               write scores
      --adjacency-matrix PATH   path to adjacency-matrix of graph
      --crop-size CROP_SIZE     crop size
      --result-path PATH        path for saving result (default: none)

## Test
Modify the path of data before running the script.

    sh test.sh
