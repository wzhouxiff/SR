# Deep Reasoning with Knowledge Graph for Social Relationship Understanding

This repo includes the source code of the paper: "[Deep Reasoning with Knowledge Graph for Social Relationship Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00504)" (IJCAI 2018) by Zhouxia Wang, Tianshui Chen, Jimmy Ren, Weihao Yu, Hui Cheng, Liang Lin.

## Environment

The code is tested on 64 bit Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), and besed on Pytorch with Python 2.7.

## Dataset
[PISC](https://zenodo.org/record/1059155#.WznPu_F97CI) was released by J. Li et al. in ICCV 2017. It involves two-level relationship, coarse-level relationship(alias domain) which has 3 categories and fine-level relationship which has 6 categories. More details can be found in the [link](https://zenodo.org/record/1059155#.WznPu_F97CI) or in our paper.

[PIPA-relation](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/human-activity-recognition/social-relation-recognition/) was released by Q. Sun et al. in CVPR 2017. It also involves two-level relationship, 5 social domains and 16 social relations. In our experiment, we only focus on the 16 social relations.

      --print-freq N, -p N      print frequency (default: 10)
      --weights PATH            path to weights (default: none)
      --scale-size SCALE_SIZE   input size
      --world-size WORLD_SIZE   number of distributed processes
      -n N, --num-classes N     number of classes / categories
      --write-out               write scores
      --adjacency-matrix PATH   path to adjacency-matrix of graph
      --crop-size CROP_SIZE     crop size
      --result-path PATH        path for saving result (default: none)

## Test
Modify the path of data before running the script.

    sh test.sh
